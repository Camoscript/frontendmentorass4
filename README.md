## My process

### Built with
- CSS Flex-box
- HTML 5 Markup


### What I learned

It was very challenging to finish this project, especially making it responsive to mobile view.
But i learnt a new way of lining content using column-reverse flex direction.

```I really like this code
.card{
        flex-direction: column-reverse;
        margin:40px auto 0px;
        width: 300px;
        height: 700px;
    }
```

### Continued development

The next area I will continue to look into is the CSS grid system.
Now I am familiar with the CSS flex properties, it's time to move on to grid.
